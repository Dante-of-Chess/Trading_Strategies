***Trading Strategies Repository***


Welcome to my Trading Strategies Repository, where I explore and share various algorithmic trading strategies I have reviewed. This repository serves as a platform to showcase my work, share insights with other traders and developers, and refine my approaches through collaboration. Feel free to delve into the strategies, test them out, and contribute your thoughts or improvements.

***Strategies Overview***


**1. Pairs Trading: Bitcoin and Ethereum**
This strategy contains a pairs trading strategy developed for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The key premise of this strategy is based on the cointegration test results between these two cryptocurrencies. After confirming their cointegration, I designed a trading strategy that exploits this relationship to generate potential arbitrage opportunities.

**2. Predictive Model Using LightGBM**
In this section, you'll find a predictive model that utilizes LightGBM, an efficient gradient boosting framework, to forecast Bitcoin price movements. The model takes into account various variables, which might include market sentiment indicators, price volatility, and other relevant financial metrics.

**Future Work**
This repository is a work in progress, and I plan to add more strategies and enhance the existing ones as I continue my research and get more insights. Updates will be made periodically as new ideas and methodologies emerge.
